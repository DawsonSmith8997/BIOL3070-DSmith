# ABSTRACT

Opioid pain relief isn’t the same for every cancer patient, and genetics
likely explains part of that. Using summary EPOS data, I built two
figures: (1) a simple regression showing how enrichment strength (−log10
p) changes with the number of genes per term (Table 2), and (2) a
chromosome-wise view of SNP associations that highlights rs12948783 near
RHBDF2 (Table 3). The regression suggests larger gene sets tend to show
stronger enrichment, and the SNP plot shows where top signals sit in the
genome. Because I only have summary tables (not patient-level rows), I
also include a draft multiple-regression code chunk (dose × genotype
with covariates) for when/if row-level data are available. Overall,
these figures connect the genetic signal to EPOS findings and set up the
next step toward individualized pain management.

# BACKGROUND

Pain control on opioids varies widely, even at similar doses. Clinical
factors explain some of it, but prior EPOS work points to a genetic
component, including a variant near RHBDF2 (rs12948783). I don’t have
patient-level outcomes or doses; I do have the study’s Table 2 (term
enrichment) and Table 3 (top SNPs). So I’m first visualizing what’s
available to ground the story: do bigger gene sets show stronger
enrichment, and where does rs12948783 fall among the top SNP signals?
This keeps the genetics focus clear while I stage the planned
patient-level model for later.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

# Question

With the EPOS summary tables, do larger gene sets show stronger
enrichment (Table 2), and where does rs12948783 rank among the top SNP
associations across chromosomes (Table 3)?

# Hypothesis

Terms with more genes will have stronger enrichment (higher −log10 p),
and rs12948783 will appear among notable SNP signals in the summary
results.

# Prediction

I expect a positive relationship in the summary enrichment data: terms
with more genes should show stronger signals, so −log10(p) should
increase as gene count increases (Table 2). On the SNP side, I expect
rs12948783 near RHBDF2 to appear among the notable association signals
when plotted by chromosome (Table 3), consistent with prior EPOS
findings.

# METHODS

I imported the EPOS Excel workbook and worked directly from the summary
tables available. From Table 2, I ran a simple linear regression of
−log10(p) on gene count and plotted a scatter with an OLS line and 95%
CI. From Table 3, I plotted −log10(p) versus position (Mb) within each
chromosome and highlighted rs12948783; I cleaned headers, dropped the
note row, and used sparse x-axis ticks so labels are readable. Because I
don’t have patient-level rows (pain relief, dose, genotype, country,
gender), I also included a draft multiple-regression code
block—pain_relief ~ dose \* genotype + country + gender—marked
eval=FALSE as the planned analysis if individual-level data become
available. All code is in the .Rmd using tidyverse/ggplot2.
